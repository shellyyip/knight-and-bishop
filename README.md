Knight & Bishop
================

This app displays a knight and bishop on a chess board, and allows for legal
chess movements for each piece.
Pieces are moved by drag & drop (mouse only, will not work on touch devices)
Pieces highlight in yellow when clicked and held.
When a piece is dragged over a legal square, the square will highlight in green.
When a piece is dragged over an illegal square, the square will highlight in 
red.
